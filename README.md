Abstract: 
>*The current COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis, with severe economic impacts and social damages. Mathematical models are playing an important role in this
ongoing emergency, providing scientific support to inform public policies worldwide. In this
thesis work, an epidemic model for the spread of the novel Coronavirus disease in the Veneto
region has been proposed. Starting from the available local Health System data to examine
past year contagion numbers and other features potentiality, a SEIQRD (Susceptible Exposed
Infected Quarantined Removed Deceased) compartmental schema has been designed generalizing the classic SIR model. Then, the infection dynamics have been practically implemented
in two versions: as a Deterministic Equation-based formulation and as an Agent-based model.
While the former has been maintained simple and computationally inexpensive in order to
serve as a baseline and to quickly provide parameter estimates, for the latter a detailed metapopulation of agents with personalized attributes and network of contacts has been developed
to recreate as realistic as possible simulations. Once these models have been trained and validated, they could became valuable tools for various types of analysis and predictions. In particular, the agent-based version, thanks to its flexibility as well as to its higher resolution, could be
exploited for exclusive a posteriori evaluations of the effectiveness of the adopted containment
measures in reducing the pandemic in Veneto.*

## Repository structure

### Code

* `ABmodel.py` contains the definitions of the agent attributes/methods and the Network Agent-Based model as `mesa` objects together with the main function to run its simulations;
* `ABmodel_utils.py` contains different utility functions called by `ABmodel.py` to generate the synthetic meta-population, keep trace of results and produce graphical summaries;
* `DETmodel.py` contains the definition of the Deterministic model ODEs System and the function to obtain numerical solutions;
* `COVID-19 models.ipynb.py` shows easy examples of models functions call, simulations and plottings;
* in `fit_expDET.py` is implemented the training procedure for the Deterministic model and an example of forecasting;
* in `fitABM_par.py` is implemented the training procedure for the Agent-Based model;
* `expABM_par.py` contains the code to reproduce different pandemic scenarious and an example of forecasting with the Agent-Based model. 

### Data
